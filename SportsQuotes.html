      <p>Sports have always played a big part in my life. I feel that the skills you learn
          not just physically but mentally as well really help people outside of the playing feild.
          Some of the skills i learned were, working together with a team, competition and wanting to be
          the best at what you are doing, as well as performing under pressure. I wanted to share some of
          the quotes that would drive me while practing and playing from some of the top athletes of their
          respective sports
